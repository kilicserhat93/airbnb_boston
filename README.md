4-Summary of Results:

I worked on the Airbnb Boston data. 
I saw that the bed type of home/room plays a role on the customers rating.
Besides, I checked the response time of hosts and saw that hosts of homes with higher prices respond faster than other hosts. 
While the average price of hosts who responds within a day is 155 and who responds within a few hours is 190.
Lastly, I made a model and tried to see which features are most effective on the price. 
The room type is the most effective feature, bed type is the second and number of bathrooms is third most effective feature on the price of a home.
